Research Question: What is the relationship between country, consumption, and food type?

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(sf)
```

```{r}
tuesdata <- tt_load('2020-02-18')
fc <- tuesdata$food_consumption
```

```{r}
str(fc)
head(fc, 22)
```

#Clean the data

```{r}
fcc <- fc |>
  mutate(food_category = fct_recode(food_category,
    "Lamb" = "Lamb & Goat",
    "Dairy" = "Milk - inc. cheese",
    "Wheat" = "Wheat and Wheat Products",
    "Nuts" = "Nuts inc. Peanut Butter"))

view(fcc$food_category)
```

#Research Question 1
Which five countries consume the most food?

```{r}
top_countries <- fcc |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarize(total_consumption = sum(consumption, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_consumption)) |>
  slice_head(n = 5)  

```

```{r}
#Plot it, bar graph stylzzz

ggplot(top_countries, aes(x = reorder(country, total_consumption), y = total_consumption, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(
    title = "Top 5 Countries by Total Food Consumption",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Total Food Consumption (kg per capita)",
    fill = "Country") +
  theme_minimal()

```
#Research Question 2
Which top five countries consume each food?

```{r}
# Clean the data - Find top 5 consuming countries for each food category
top_countries_per_food <- fcc |>
  group_by(food_category, country) |>
  summarize(total_consumption = sum(consumption, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  arrange(food_category, desc(total_consumption)) |>
  group_by(food_category) |>
  slice_head(n = 5) 

```

```{r}
#Plot it
ggplot(top_countries_per_food, aes(x = reorder(country, total_consumption), y = total_consumption, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +  #Hard to see countries the other way
  facet_wrap(~ food_category, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 5 Countries by Food Consumption per Category",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Total Food Consumption (kg per capita)",
    fill = "Country") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#Research Question 3
What does the consumption of each food look like?

```{r}
food_map_data <- fcc|>
  group_by(country, food_category) |>
  summarize(total_consumption = sum(consumption, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Plot a choropleth - load map data
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

# Join food consumption data with world map data
map_data <- world |>
  left_join(food_map_data, by = c("name" = "country"))

# Plot choropleth map
ggplot(map_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = total_consumption), color = "gray40") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma", na.value = "white") +  
  facet_wrap(~ food_category) + 
  labs(
    title = "Food Consumption by Country",
    fill = "Total Consumption (kg per capita)") +
  theme_minimal()

```
