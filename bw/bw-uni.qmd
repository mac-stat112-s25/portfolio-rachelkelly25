title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")

# Load the package
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Hike Elevations",
    x = "Hike Elevation (feet)",
    y = "Number of Hikes",
    caption = "Data Source: https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv",
    alt = "A histogram showing the distribution of hike elevations, with elevation on the x-axis and number of hikes on the y-axis.") +
  theme_minimal()
```
