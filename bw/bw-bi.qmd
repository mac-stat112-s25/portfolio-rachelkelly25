title: "Bivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis) 
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma") + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature Distribution at 3 PM by Location in Australian Cities",
    x = "Temperature at 3 PM (Â°C)",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Location",
    caption = "Data Source: https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv, Plot by: Rachel Kelly, 2/19/2025",
    alt = "A density plot showing temperature distributions at 3 PM for different locations in Australian cities. Each location is represented by a different color."
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
