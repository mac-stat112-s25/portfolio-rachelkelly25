title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
# Import and check out data
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Educational Expenditure and SAT Scores",
    x = "Per-Student Expenditure (in USD)",
    y = "Average SAT Score",
    color = "Fraction Category",
    caption = "Data Source: https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv, Plot by: Rachel Kelly, 3/12/2025",
    alt = "A scatter plot showing the relationship between per-student expenditure and SAT scores, with points colored by fraction category."
